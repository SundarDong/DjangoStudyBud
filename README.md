1. I started to write the README.md file from studying the rooms list for rendering in the home.html. and i used that rooms list to see in the home.html code by using the {% tag%} and using the for loop.

2. Then after we set the dynamic routing to fetch the list of the rooms according to their ID by specingin them in their base app Urls.py.
