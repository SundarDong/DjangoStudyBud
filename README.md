# DjangoStudyBud

1.I started to write the README.md file from studying the rooms list for rendering in the home.html. and i used that rooms list to see in the home.html code by using the {% tag%} and using the for loop.

2.Then after we set the dynamic routing to fetch the list of the rooms according to their ID by specingin them in their base app Urls.py.

3.Now, we implement the ROOM Name with their list ID. And we can see the Room ID in the urls section of the Brower.

4.Then after we will talk about the Database and Admin Panel after we finished the talk about Views, URls and templates.

5.Now, we will works on the Database and Model Design for the Base app templated instead of manual data flows.

6.Now we can see the data modal in the Admin prebuild panel in the python and we can see the modal in the Data base table.

7.(Here There is a small Gap due to my personal Reasons.)

8.After some rest then we will create the New Modal Topic and Message which is linked to the parent modal Room. Model Topic and Message get the Foreign key of Room Model.

9.Then after we will make the CRUD opertaions. Before CRUD operations we will update the home template by rendering the Dynamic topic and message rending from backend.

10.Now we will create the New Forms using the ModalForm using the Django package. And after we will display the form as similar in the backend django admistration and insert the data into backend using that form.

11.Now we will implement the Delete of the CRUD operations in the Django.
