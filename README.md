# DjangoStudyBud

1. I started to write the README.md file from studying the rooms list for rendering in the home.html. and i used that rooms list to see in the home.html code by using the {% tag%} and using the for loop.

2. Then after we set the dynamic routing to fetch the list of the rooms according to their ID by specingin them in their base app Urls.py.

3.Now, we implement the ROOM Name with their list ID. And we can see the Room ID in the urls section of the Brower.

4.Then after we will talk about the Database and Admin Panel after we finished the talk about Views, URls and templates.

5.Now, we will works on the Database and Model Design for the Base app templated instead of manual data flows.
